# Nodo Periférico - Frontend (Admin)

A small React app for local admin tasks (alta de clínica) that talks to the backend under `/nodo-periferico`.

Quick start:

1. From this folder:

```powershell
cd componente-periferico/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

2. The app expects the backend running at `http://localhost:8080/nodo-periferico` by default. You can override it with environment variable `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.

Note: This is a minimal scaffold for development and manual testing; expand it as needed.
